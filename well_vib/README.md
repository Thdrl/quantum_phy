# Numerical study of a triangular quantum well and ruby vibrations

This project, condensed in a PDF made with LateX (in French), uses python to study analytical solutions to quantum physics problems.

The codes used can be found in the appendixes. 'A' for the well, 'B' for the ruby.

Note that the last figure was made in part with Photoshop.
